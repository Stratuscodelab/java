//this is showing how the IF Else works 

def number = 7

if (number > 5) {
    println "number is greater than 5"
} else {
    println "number is less than 5"
}

// as you can see the def number is used in the brackets to define the number and then the if else statement is used to check if the number is greater than 5 or less than 5
